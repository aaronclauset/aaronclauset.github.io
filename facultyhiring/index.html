<p><b>Network ranking code</b><br/>
This function takes as input an adjacency matrix representing a directed 
network and runs a zero-temperature Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to 
sample all minimum violation rankings (MVRs) of the input network. Usage 
information is included in the file; type 'help mvrsample' at the Matlab 
prompt for more information.
<br/><i>NOTE: we cannot provide technical support for code not written by us, and we are busy with other projects now and so may not provide support for our own code.</i>

<p><b>Faculty hiring data</b><br/>
Data on 18,924 tenure or tenure-track faculty was collected between May 2011 
and August 2013 for the disciplines of Computer Science, Business, and 
History. All data was collected and validated by hand from primary sources 
(mainly departmental webpages and faculty homepages). The following table 
gives a brief sketch of the data included in the study, which represents the 
16,316 faculty at the within-sample institutions who received their doctorates 
from another within-sample institution. (About 14% of faculty received their 
doctorates from outside our sample, mainly from foreign universities.) These 
data represent the largest and most comprehensive survey of faculty placements 
collected at the time of publication in 2015.

<p>These data are provided separately for each discipline. One file contains 
the directed edges <i>(u,v)</i>, each of which denotes a person who received 
their doctorate from institution <i>u</i> and was faculty at institution 
<i>v</i> during the collection period. Each 
edge is annotated with the faculty rank of that individual at <i>v</i> and 
that person's gender. A second file contains vertex attribute information, 
including the prestige score assigned by the MVR sampling algorithm, its 
USNews rank and the National Research Council rank (if available) most recent 
to the collection period, its geographic region (generally US Census), and 
the institution's name. Missing values are denoted by a period '.'. All files 
are plain text. No personally identifying information is included in the files 
(but these data are by no means anonymous). Additional details of the data 
can be found in the paper's Supplementary Materials.

<p><b>Interactive visualizations</b><br/>
Dan Larremore has put together <a href="http://danlarremore.com/faculty/">an 
interactive visualization of these data</a>. 
Within each discipline, you can explore different aspects of the network, 
examine individual institutions, and inspect the flows of faculty between 
specific pairs of institutions within the prestige hierarchy. <br/>

<p><b>A note on the software and data</b><br/>
The Matlab code for mvrsample.m was designed to be compatible with Matlab 
v7.13 (2011). It is not necessarily compatible with older versions of Matlab; 
it should be compatible with newer versions (for the foreseeable future).<br/>

The code and data are provided as-is, with no warranty, express or implied, 
no guarantee of correctness, no guarantees of technical support or 
maintenance, etc. The code is released under <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">GPLv2</a> and the data under the 
<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">CC-BY-NC license</a>
 attached to the paper. If you experience problems while using the code or 
data, please let me know via email. I am happy to host (or link to) 
implementations of the mvrsample program in other programming languages, but 
cannot provide any technical support for such code. If you are interested 
in commercialization of these ideas, code, or data please in contact me.<br/>

Finally, if you use my code in an academic publication, it would be 
courteous of you to thank me in your acknowledgements for providing you with 
implementations of the methods. </p>

<p><b>Updates</b><br/>
<i>15 October 2017</i>: added the C version of mvrsample, by Huanshen Wei<br/>
<i>12 February 2015</i>: initial page created and posted; including version 1.0 of data,  version 1.0 of mvrsample, and links to interactive visualizations.
