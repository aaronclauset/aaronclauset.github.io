<!-- <b><a href="/courses/3352/">Biological Networks (undergraduate)</a></b><br/>
Spring 2022, CSCI 3352<br/><br/>

This course examines the computational representation and analysis of biological phenomena through the structure and dynamics of networks, from molecules to species. Attention focuses on algorithms for clustering network structures, predicting missing information, modeling flows, regulation, and spreading-process dynamics, examining the evolution of network structure, and developing intuition for how network structure and dynamics relate to biological phenomena.

<!-- <b><a href="/courses/3104/">Algorithms (undergraduate)</a></b><br/>
Spring 2018, CSCI 3104<br/><br/>

Algorithms are the heart of computer science, and their essential nature is to automate some aspect of the collecting, organizing and processing of information. Today, information of all kinds is increasingly available in enormous quantities. However, our ability to make sense of all this information, to manage, organize and search it, and to use it for practical purposes, e.g., self-driving cars, adaptive computation, search algorithms for the Internet or for social networks, artificial intelligence, and many scientific applications, relies on the design of efficient algorithms, that is, algorithms that are fast, use little memory and provide guarantees on their performance. <br/><br/>

This undergraduate-level course will cover topics related to algorithm design and analysis. Topics will include asymptotic analysis, time and space constraints, dynamic programming, divide and conquer, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, computability, and a selection of advanced topics. 
The focus throughout will be on algorithmic thinking, performance guarantees and boundary cases, efficient solutions to practical problems and understanding how to analyze algorithms. Advanced topics will cover a selection of modern algorithms, many of which come from real-world applications.<br/>

<b><a href="/courses/5352/">Network Analysis and Modeling</a></b> (graduate)<br/>

Fall 2022, CSCI 5352<br/><br/>

This graduate-level course will examine modern techniques for analyzing and modeling the structure and dynamics of complex networks. The focus will be on statistical algorithms and methods, and both lectures and assignments will emphasize model interpretability and understanding the processes that generate real data. Applications will be drawn from computational biology and computational social science. No biological or social science training is required. (Note: this is not a scientific computing course, but there will be plenty of computing for science.)


<!-- <b><a href="/courses/4830/">History and Future of Computing</a></b> (undergraduate)<br/>

Spring 2016, CSCI 4830<br/><br/>

Computer science is often viewed as an inherently modern discipline, but its intellectual roots and many of its core technologies reach back many generations. In this class, we will survey and ponder the history and the future of computing. 

This upper division undergraduate course will survey and ponder the history and future of computing. This course will focus on the technical context and trajectory of fundamental innovations in the history of computing (e.g., Babbage’s Difference Engine, the telegraph and Morse code, early "networks," information theory, numerical computation, the early Internet, etc.), and on computing’s likely future (Internet of Things, wearables and privacy, P vs. NP, ubiquitous artificial intelligence, self-driving cars, etc.). Students are expected to think critically about both the technical and the social aspects of computing in these contexts, and should be prepared to discuss the grand arc of computational progress, the specific technologies that have fueled it, and the problems, opportunities, and challenges computing poses for society.

<!-- CSCI 7000
Computers are fundamentally changing how science is done by allowing us to 
record enormous amounts of data on social, biological, technological and 
physical systems. This data glut should allow us both to address old questions 
about complex systems in new ways and to answer fundamentally new kinds of 
questions. But, our ability to do this relies on the development of new 
algorithms to automatically extract information about patterns in these huge 
data sets and to reliably test complex scientific hypotheses about the 
processes that create those patterns. Examples include understanding the 
evolution of the Internet (at various levels), social behavior on the Web 
(Facebook, Wikipedia, Twitter, etc.), the role of networks in structuring 
complex social behaviors and biological functions, the emergence of 
population-scale patterns from seemingly random individual-level behavior, and 
forecasting rare but important events in the future. 
<br/><br/>

This graduate-level topics course will cover a selection of recent 
developments in computational approaches to doing science with complex 
systems. It is not a scientific computing course. Topics will include 
statistical inference, the structure of complex networks, macro-phenomena in 
biological evolution and in wars and terrorism, simple mathematical models, 
and simulation techniques for more complicated models. The focus will be on 
using computational tools (algorithms) to do science (work with data; test 
hypotheses; build understanding; make predictions).
