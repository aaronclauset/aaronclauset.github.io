<p><b>Power-law Distributions in Empirical Data</b></p>

<p><img src="http://www.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/powerlaw_example.jpg" width="250" height="188" align="right">This page is a companion for the <i>SIAM 
Review</i> paper on power-law distributions in empirical data, written by 
<a href="http://www.santafe.edu/~aaronc/">Aaron Clauset</a> (me), 
<a href="http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/">Cosma R. Shalizi</a> and 
<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/">M.E.J. Newman</a>. <br/><br/>

This page hosts implementations of the methods we describe in the article, 
including several by authors other than us. Our goal is for the methods to 
be widely accessible to the community.<br/><br/>

Python users should refer to the 
<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1305.0215">powerlaw package</a> by Alstott et al.<br/>
R users should refer to the <a href="https://github.com/csgillespie/poweRlaw">poweRlaw package</a> by Gillespie<br/><br/>
<i>NOTE: we cannot provide technical support for code not written by us, and 
we are busy with other projects now and so may not provide support for our own 
code.</i>

<p><b>Random number generators</b><br/>
This function generates continuous values randomly distributed according to 
one of the five distributions discussed in the article (power law, 
exponential, log-normal, stretched exponential, and power law with cutoff).

prompt for more information.<br/>

<p><b>Fitting a power-law distribution</b><br/>
This function implements both the discrete and continuous maximum likelihood 
estimators for fitting the power-law distribution to data, along with the 
goodness-of-fit based approach to estimating the lower cutoff for the scaling 
region. Usage information is included in the file; type 'help plfit' at the 
Matlab prompt for more information.<br/>

<p><b>Visualizing the fitted distribution</b><br/>
After several requests, I've written this function, which plots (on log-log 
axes) the empirical distribution along with the fitted power-law distribution. 
Usage information is included in the file; type 'help plplot' at the Matlab 
prompt for more information.<br/>

<p><b>Estimating uncertainty in the fitted parameters</b><br/>
This function implements the nonparametric approach for estimating the 
uncertainty in the estimated parameters for the power-law fit found by the 
plfit function. It too implements both continuous and discrete versions. Usage 
information is included in the file; type 'help plvar' at the Matlab prompt 
for more information.<br/>

<a href="plvar.py">plvar.py</a> (Python, by Joel Ornstein)</p>

<p><b>Calculating <i>p</i>-value for fitted power-law model</b><br/>
This function implements the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (which computes a 
<i>p</i>-value for the estimated power-law fit to the data) for the power-law 
model. As above, it too implements both continuous and discrete versions of 
the test. Usage information is included in the file; type 'help plpva' at the 
Matlab prompt for more information.<br/>

<a href="plpva.py">plpva.py</a> (Python, by Joel Ornstein)</p>

<p><b>Riemann Zeta function</b><br/>
The discrete estimator needs to calculate the Hurwitz Zeta function for 
normalization. Matlab includes this function in the Symbolic Math Toolbox 
(but be warned that their implementation becomes unstable for large alpha and 
xmin, e.g., alpha>7 with xmin>150). There are also free versions available if 
you don't have this toolbox. For instance, Paul Godfrey's 
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=978">special functions library</a> (via Matlab Central File Exchange) gives one, which we 
mirror here (note, you need both these files; tip to Will Tracy).<br/>

<p><b>Calculating likelihood-ratio test results</b><br/>
The functions necessary to compute the log likelihood ratio tests is 
implemented in the <a href="http://www.r-project.org/">statistical programming 
language R</a>. Documentation of these functions is given in a separate file, 
and the R functions themselves are in a downloadable tgz file (note: this is 
not a proper R package, yet).<br/>

<p><b>A note Matlab compatibility</b><br/>
For the Matlab functions written by me (Aaron), all of them were designed to 
be compatible with Matlab v7. They are <i>not</i> necessarily compatible with 
older versions of Matlab. That being said, it should be possible to make them 
compatible as the core functionality does not depend on v7 features.

<p><b>A note about bugs and alternative implementations</b><br/>
The code provided here is provided as-is, with no warranty, with no guarantees 
of technical support or maintenance, etc. If you experience problems while 
using the code, please let the author(s) know via email. I am happy to host 
(or link to) implementations of any of these functions in other programming 
languages, in the interest of facilitating their more widespread use. 
However, I cannot provide any technical support for that code.
The original pl* functions (Matlab) were written by Aaron Clauset and the LRT 
functions (R) were written by Cosma Shalizi; all other language 
implementations were written by members of the wider community.<br/>

Finally, if you use our code in an academic publication, it would be 
courteous of you to thank me (Aaron) and Cosma in your acknowledgements for 
providing you with implementations of the methods. If you use the 
implementations by other authors, you should acknowledge them instead.</p>

<p><b>A note the data sets</b><br/>
The 24 data sets we studied in the paper were drawn from the literature, and 
the proper citations are given in the paper. You can find much more detailed 
information, including links to download many of the data sets, 
<a href="data.htm">here</a>.

<p><b>A note about method tutorials</b><br/>
We do not currently have any tutorial information for installing or using 
these methods, beyond what we describe in the paper and what is contained in 
the help files that go with the Matlab and R files themselves. That being 
said, the InterSciWiki at UC Irvine has 
<a href="http://intersci.ss.uci.edu/wiki/index.php/Power-law_distributions">a 
good overview tutorial page</a> that may be of some use, and Willy Lai has 
created a <a href="http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~aldous/Research/Ugrad/Willy_Lai.pdf">
nice page, with R code, that works through several examples</a>.

<i>8 October 2010</i>: replaced plfit.r with new version, at request of its author Laurent Dubroca.<br/>
<i>24 January 2010</i>: fixed a minor bug in how plfit.m reports the log-likelihood of the fitted data, for the discrete case, after the selection of xmin is done; posted updated version of Wim Otte's code with the same fix.<br/>

<i>1 October 2009</i>: added the option in plfit, plvar and plpva to 'lock' xmin to a specific value (thanks to Paul Willems for the suggestion).<br/>
<i>27 August 2009</i>: posted Adam Ginsburg's Python implementation of plfit.<br/>
<i>13 August 2009</i>: created a new page with detailed information 
about obtaining copies of <a href="data.htm">the 24 empirical data sets</a> we studied</a>.<br/>
<i>12 August 2009</i>: fixed a minor bug in the R version of plfit that would cause its 
results to disagree slightly with the results from the matlab version (thanks to Naoki 
Masuda for pointing it out).<br/>
<i>17 March 2009</i>: fixed a minor bug in the R version of plfit that would cause the 
returned KS statistic to be incorrect when xmin=1 (thanks to Jeff Stuckman for 
pointing it out).<br/>

pseudo-random number generator on the first time they are called.<br/>
<i>5 March 2008</i>: in the integer routines, plfit, plvar and plpva now automatically 
switch to a slower but more memory efficient estimation routine when the vectorized 
default routine fails (e.g., Out of Memory error when max(x) is extremely large).<br/>

efficiency improvements to xmin estimation routine in plfit.m, plpva.m and plvar.m 
(thanks to Jim Bagrow for suggestions).<br/>
<i>7 September 2007</i>: corrected interim reporting in plpva.m; changed plfit.m, 
plvar.m and plpva.m to reshape input vector to column format, and to prevent using 
continuous approximation in small-sample regime for discrete data.<br/>
<i>25 July 2007</i>: corrected a typo in plvar.m, typo in pareto.R, typo in 
log-likelihood for discrete cut-off powerlaw and fixed small bug in a plotting
