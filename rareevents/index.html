<p><b>Estimating the probability of rare events</b></p>

<p><img src="http://www.santafe.edu/~aaronc/rareevents/powerlaw_example.jpg" width="250" height="188" align="right">This page is a companion for the 
article on estimating the historical and future probability of rare events,
written by 
<a href="http://www.santafe.edu/~aaronc/">Aaron Clauset</a> (me), and
<a href="http://www.er.ethz.ch/people/rwoodard">Ryan Woodard</a>.

This page hosts implementations of the methods we describe in the article. 
For now, these are simply the versions we wrote (in Matlab and Python), but 
in the future includes those by others.<br/>
<i>NOTE: that we cannot provide support for any code not written by ourselves.</i></p>


<p><b>Journal Reference</b><br/>
A. Clauset and R. Woodard, 
"<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.0089">Estimating the historical and future probabilities of large terrorist events</a>." <i>Annals of Applied Statistics</i> <b>7</b>(4), 1838-1865 (2013).<br/>
(Subject of a special session at ASA Joint Statistical Meetings, Montreal Canada, 5 August 2013)
<br/><br/></p>

<p><b>Dependencies</b><br/>
The Matlab implementation requires access to the plfit.m procedure and an 
implementation of the zeta function, both of which can be found 
<a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/powerlaws/">here</a>.<br/><br/>

Python code requires <a href="http://numpy.scipy.org/">numpy</a> and 
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/mpmath/">mpmath</a> (for the zeta function). 
Both are available in standard packaging (ubuntu, for example). 
<a href="http://scipy.org/Download">Scipy</a> is needed for some plotting 
niceties, but not for the main tasks.
</p>

<p><b>Power law outlier detection (single variable)</b><br/>
This function implements both the discrete and continuous power-law 
outlier detection algorithms described in the paper. Usage information is 
included in the file; type 'help plout' at the Matlab prompt for more 
information.<br/>
<a href="plout.m">plout.m</a> (Matlab)<br/>
plout.py (Python)</p>


<p><b>Power law outlier detection (with discrete covariates)</b><br/>
This function implements the same method as plout but for integer-valued 
event covariates. The function applies the method to each of the marginal 
distributions and combines the results across them. Type 'help ploutm' at the 
Matlab prompt for more information.<br/>
<a href="ploutm.m">ploutm.m</a> (Matlab)<br/>
ploutm.py (Python)</p>


<p><b>Visualizing the ensemble of fitted distributions</b><br/>
This function takes the output of plout (or ploutm) and plots a portion of the 
ensemble of fitted models against the empirical data on log-log axes. Usage 
information is included in the file; type 'help pleplot' at the Matlab prompt 
for more information.<br/>
<a href="pleplot.m">pleplot.m</a> (Matlab)</p>


<p><b>Matlab compatibility issues</b><br/>
All of the Matlab functions here were designed to be compatible with Matlab 
v7. They are <i>not</i> necessarily compatible with older versions of Matlab. 
That being said, it should be possible to make them compatible as the core 
functionality does not depend on v7 features.


<p><b>A note about bugs and alternative implementations</b><br/>
The code provided here is provided as-is, with no warranty, with no guarantees 
of technical support or maintenance, etc. If you experience problems while 
using the code, please let us know via email. We are also happy to host (or 
link to) implementations of any of these functions in other programming 
languages. If you have questions about any of the implementations, please 
contact the respective function's author; the Matlab functions were written 
by Aaron Clauset and the Python functions were written by Ryan Woodard.
<br/>

Finally, if you use our code in an academic publication, it would be courteous 
of you to thank us in your acknowledgements for providing you with 
implementations of the methods.</p>


<p><b>Data for replication purposes</b><br/>
To facilitate the replication of our results, we are providing access to the 
empirical data used to make our calculations. (Due to licensing restrictions, 
we cannot provide access to the original databases.) If you use these data 
in a publication, please cite the original source. The accompanying README 
file explains the file format and provides additional information.

<p><b>Updates</b><br/>
<i>9 March 2012</i>: version 1.0.1 of plout and ploutm (Matlab) functions 
posted; these versions better document the bootstrap features and describe 
how to extract confidence intervals from the results.<br/>
<i>3 January 2012</i>: initial version of Matlab functions posted.<br/>

<!--
<p><b>Riemann Zeta function</b><br/>
The discrete estimator needs to calculate the Riemann Zeta function for 
normalization. Matlab includes this function in the Symbolic Math Toolbox, but 
there are free versions available if you don't have this toolbox. For 
instance, Paul Godfrey's 
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectId=978">special functions library</a> 
(via Matlab Central File Exchange) gives one, which we mirror here (note, you 
need both these files; tip to Will Tracy).<br/>
<a href="deta.m">deta.m</a> (Matlab)<br/>
<a href="zeta.m">zeta.m</a> (Matlab)</p>

<p><b>Download all files</b><br/>
To make getting the most up-to-date versions of the original files (in Matlab and R) even 
easier, they're available as a downloadable tgz file here.<br/>
</p>

<p><b>A note the data sets</b><br/>
The 24 data sets we studied in the paper were drawn from the literature, and 
the proper citations are given in the paper. You can find much more detailed 
information, including links to download many of the data sets, 
<a href="data.htm">here</a>.
