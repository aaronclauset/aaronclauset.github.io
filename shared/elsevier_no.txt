I am writing to let you know that I am declining to review the manuscript submitted to [Name of Journal]. I do not feel right providing uncompensated labor, in the form of refereeing, to a for-profit enterprise such as Elsevier, the company that publishes [Name of Journal]. In 2010 Reed-Elsevier reported an operating profit of over 1.8 Billion euros. Much of this profit comes at the expense of the scientific community. Authors and referees are uncompensated. And for-profit journals such as those owned by Elsevier charge subscriptions rates that are, on average, between 3 and 6 times as expensive as those produced by non-profit professional societies. These exorbitant costs must be born by college and university libraries -- organizations which are, for the most part, publicly funded. Elsevier reaps large profits from uncompensated labor of the scientific community and directly from public expenditures for university libraries.

I have thus decided to no longer perform referring services to Elsevier journals. I can no longer in good conscience support for-profit academic journal publishers such as Elsevier, as I believe Elsevier is ultimately harmful to the scientific enterprise.
