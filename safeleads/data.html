<p><b>Safe leads and lead changes in competitive team sports</b></p>

<p>This page is a companion for the article on the statistics of leads in 
competitive team sports, written by 
<a href="http://www.santafe.edu/~aaronc/">Aaron Clauset</a>,
<a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ST-2CicAAAAJ">Marina Kogan</a>, and
<a href="http://physics.bu.edu/~redner/">Sid Redner</a>.

This page hosts additional information related to the article, including 
information about the data used, <!-- the author order, --> and simulation code for the 
homogeneous and inhomogeneous Poisson processes.

<p><b>Sports data</b><br/>
The data used in our study were licensed from <a href="http://www.stats.com">STATS LLC</a>, which included historical data on every point-scoring event in 
every league game for NFL, NHL, NBA, and NCAA college football (CFB) over 
approximately a 10 year period. The terms of the license prevent us from 
releasing the data publicly. However, as we mention in the article, as of this 
writing, there are other, publicly available sources of similar data.<br/><br/>

The NBA provides detailed play-by-play data on each of its games, going back 
at least to 1997. For instance, here is a link to the final 
<a href="http://www.nba.com/games/20150614/CLEGSW/gameinfo.html">Cleveland Cavaliers vs. Golden State Warriors game</a>. <br/><br/>

ESPN provides similar play-by-play data for NFL games, going back to 2006. 
For instance, here is a link to the <a href="http://espn.go.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=400554215">Saints vs. Falcons game<a/> on 7 September 2014.<br/><br/>

The NHL provides recaps of its games that include the timing and score information (along with fouls, and some other events) for its games. For instance, 
here is a link for the <a href="http://www.nhl.com/gamecenter/en/recap?id=2014030415">Blackhawks vs. Lightning</a> game on 13 June 2015.<br/><br/>

EPSN provides data on CFB games that is comparable to its NFL data, going back 
to 2003. For instance, here is a link to the <a href="http://scores.espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=400548171&confId=9">Colorado. vs. Colorado State</a> game on 29 August 2014.<br/><br/>


<!-- <p><b>Author Order</b><br/>
By mutual agreement, author order was determined randomly, according to
when the maximum lead size occurred during the Denver Nuggetsâ€“Milwaukee Bucks
NBA game on 3 March 2015. -->

<p><b>Simulation code</b><br/>
This code runs either the homogeneous or inhomogeneous Poisson process model 
of scoring dynamics in a competitive team sport. The code requires the 
specification of the number of seconds and the scoring rate (or function, in 
the case of the inhomogeneous model), and produces as output the three 
functions described in the paper.
