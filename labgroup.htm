I am deeply interested in the lens people use to perceive the world and how people react with the perception. I believe the structure of social networks and unequal distribution of attributes (such as wealth, talents, prestige and so on) can form the perception which leads people’s collective behaviors. This collective action could restructure their social environments and adjust their perception of the world. I am eager to understand the mechanisms with the help of the complex system and mathematical modeling based on the data analysis.

An ecologist by training, I am interested in the mechanisms that drive the structure and dynamics of ecological networks. In particular, I am interested in using species’ traits (e.g. body size) to predict network structure and dynamics. I am now turning that lens on the scientific ecosystem, to learn how the “traits” of academic fields, institutions, and researchers shape academic networks.

Working with <a href="http://ccdd.hsph.harvard.edu/Faculty/Caroline-Buckee">Caroline O. Buckee</a> (HSPH) and Aaron Clauset, my primary research focus is genetic recombination in the parasite that causes a majority of malaria cases, <i>Plasmodium falciparum</i>. In this work we map sequences to networks in which recombination patterns manifest as large-scale network structures. With this in mind, I also work on statistical inference and generative network models. Previously, I studied the dynamics of excitable networks modeling neuronal avalanches in the mammalian cortex.

I am interested in the ecology and evolution of plant metabolites. In Dr. Stacey Smith's lab (EBIO), I am examining the genetic and biochemical changes associated with convergent origins of white flowers in Iochroma and its relatives (Solanaceae). In the Clauset lab I will be combining network analysis and ancestral state reconstruction to infer the evolution of the plant flavonoid pathway expression across the Iochrominae. With this analysis I aim to quantify quantify pleiotropy, modularity and network shape across multiple plant tissues and multiple species. Previously, I studied the influence of elevation on local adaptation of Silene vulgaris using metabolomics, population genetics, quantitative genetics, and RNAseq.

      My past experiences in computer science, specifically in deep learning, caused me to hesitate at the speed in which deep neural networks are deployed and the amount of trust people have in their fairness and accuracy. This is especially concerning when those networks are used in healthcare, policing, education, and other areas that have a direct impact on people’s lives. I decided to pivot to computational social science to focus on explanation rather than prediction. Specifically, I’m interested in studying structural inequality in social systems.

I’m here because I still don’t know what a complex system is. My favorite account? A complex system is a collection of agents that interact to manipulate a causal narrative. This suggests that analysis of such systems must bridge many divides, central among them the divide between an agent and the narrative it (often indirectly) attempts to manipulate. I seek to help build such bridges and hope my work shapes how we interact with complex systems for the better.
