<p><b>Hierarchical Random Graphs</b></p>

<p>
<img src="/hierarchy/hierarchy_ex_sm.jpg" width="200" height="313" align="right">
This page is a companion for the article on hierarchical random 
graphs (HRGs), written by 
<a href="/">Aaron Clauset</a> (me), 
<a href="http://www.santafe.edu/~moore/">Cris Moore</a> and 
<a href="http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/">Mark E.J. Newman</a>. This page 
hosts our implementation of the basic HRG fitting procedures described in the 
paper. The code is implemented in ANSI C++ and requires no non-standard libraries. 
The basic code for (1) running the MCMC procedure, (2) using HRGs to predict 
missing connections, and (3) constructing the consensus dendrogram, is provided 
as-is below. (Note: thanks to <a href="http://cneuro.rmki.kfki.hu/people/csardi">
Gabor Csardi</a>, the 
<a href="http://igraph.sourceforge.net/">igraph library</a> now includes both 
a <a href="http://igraph.sourceforge.net/doc-0.6/html/igraph-HRG.html">C implementation</a> and an <a href="http://igraph.sourceforge.net/doc-0.6/R/hrg.html">R implementation</a> of many of these functions. 
<a href="https://github.com/ndronen/">Nick Dronen</a> also provides a <a href="https://github.com/ndronen/PyHRG">Python implementation</a>.)</p>

<p>Each program is relatively straight-forward to use, and omits some of 
the more complex experimental things mentioned in the paper. On the other hand, 
it should be relatively clear to an intermediate-level programmer how to adapt 
this code for more complex tasks. The code runs as a command-line application, 
provides no graphical interface, and reads/writes plain text files. The code has 
been tested under Mac OS X 10.{4,5}.x and Ubuntu Linux 7.04.

<p><b>HRG file format</b><br/>
In order to support the i/o of dendrogram models, the code uses a special text format 
to describe a hierarchical random graph model. The format is basically an explicit 
representation of the dendrogram (binary tree) with probability annotations at the 
internal nodes. An example of such a model, for the <a href="http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0091-7710%28197724%2933%3A4%3C452%3AAIFMFC%3E2.0.CO%3B2-G">Zachary's karate club</a> network 
is <a href="karate_best-dendro.hrg">here</a>. The corresponding edge list file 
is <a href="karate.pairs">here</a>. Both of these files are included in the 
packages below.

<p><b>Fitting HRGs to data using MCMC</b><br/>
This code runs our Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for sampling the space 
of dendrogram models. The input format is a standard one (tab-delimited edge list); 
this code will take the input graph and run the MCMC forever. Each time it samples a 
dendrogram model with a new highest likelihood, it writes the corresponding model out 
as a text file (.hrg file) along with some additional information about the model 
(.info file). The .hrg file can be passed back to fitHRG to restart the sampling later, 
or to generate a graph instance drawn from the ensemble defined by the given model 
(-make flag). A makefile is included with the code, and can be used for standard 
compilation. Run the program with no arguments to get usage information. If the 
input text files are not formatted correctly, the program will crash.<br/>

<p><b>Predicting missing edges using HRGs</b><br/>
This code runs the MCMC algorithm on a particular input graph and outputs the list
of possible missing connections, in descending order of their likelihood under the 
sampled models. The MCMC has a built-in convergence criteria to decide when to start 
sampling (easy to modify), and the MCMC can be seeded with an HRG model (derived 
from fitHRG, perhaps). The basic code is almost identical to fitHRG, but 
with a few additional methods for making predictions.<br/>

<p><b>Consensus dendrograms</b><br/>
This code runs the MCMC algorithm from a seed HRG model (derived from fitHRG, perhaps) 
and outputs a consensus dendrogram file (-consensus.tree) which contains only the 
dendrogram features that appear in the majority of the sampled models. The basic code 
is almost identical to fitHRG, but with a few additional methods for constructing the 
consensus dendrogram.<br/>

<p><b>Visualizing HRG models</b><br/>
This matlab function draws radial dendrogram figures like the one shown here for the 
karate club network (generated by fitHRG). I cobbled this together from examining other 
dendrogram-plotting routines, and it is sufficient for visualizing .hrg files produced 
by the fitHRG code. This code can also annotate the leaf nodes with group information. 
Place this file somewhere in your Matlab path and type 'help hrgplot' for more 
information.<br/>

<p><b>Visualizing consensus dendrograms</b><br/>
This matlab function draws radial dendrogram figures generated by the consensusHRG
code. Just like the hrgplot function above, this function can also annotate the leaf 
nodes with group information. Place this file somewhere in your Matlab path and type 
'help consensusplot' for more information.<br/>

<p><b>A note about bugs and your use of this code</b><br/>
The code located here is provided as-is, with no warranty, etc. (It's under GPL v2.)
But, if you do experience problems using the code, please let me know via email. I'm 
not actively maintaining this code anymore (it's research code, so you're largely on 
your own both to understand what it does and adapt it to your needs). That being 
said, there are copious comments in the code files in case you want to modify them, 
and if you ask a short question very nicely over email, I may be able to help you out.</p>

<p>Finally, if you use this code in an academic publication, it would be courteous of 
you to thank me in your acknowledgements for providing the code.</p>

<p><b>A note about network data</b><br/>
The three network data sets we used in the <i>Nature</i> paper were drawn from the 
literature. For the two we provide here, please use the original citations (given below)

<p><b>Updates</b><br/>
<i>27 May 2012</i>: added a workaround for predictHRG for when the program seg faults while sorting candidate edges by their likelihoods; workaround writes out the unsorted list before sorting; if sorting is successful, this file is overwritten with the sorted list.<br/>
<i>19 August 2011</i>: fixed a small issue with consensusplot.m that would cause it break when vertex labels were not contiguous integers starting at 1.<br/>
<i>13 August 2009</i>: added links to and information about the three network data sets used in the <i>Nature</i> paper.<br/>
<i>30 January 2009</i>: fixed internal indexing issue in consensusplot.m when input 
file contained a leaf node with name 0.<br/>
<i>16 January 2009</i>: fixed issue with output file from fitHRG when -make is invoked.<br/>
<i>5 December 2008</i>: moved all the files from /randomgraphs to /hierarchy.<br/>
<i>22 September 2008</i>: fixed a small problem in consensusplot.m that caused it to 
throw an error when reading in .group files.<br/>
<i>18 August 2008</i>: fixed a small problem with the recordPredictions() function in 
predictHRG that prevented it from writing out the last prediction.<br/>
<i>10 June 2008</i>: fixed an error in sizing an array which would sometimes cause a 
segmentation fault in predictHRG just before writing the predictions to file. <br/>
<i>21 May 2008</i>: minor tweaks to fitHRG and predictHRG code (mainly cleaning up the 
code a little more, making header information standard, etc.). Fixed a memory 
deallocation issue in predictHRG that effects some users. <br/>
<i>21 May 2008</i>: Placed initial version of consensus HRG and consensusplot.m code 
online. <br/>
<i>29 April 2008</i>: placed initial version of hrgplot.m code online. <br/>
<i>1 January 2008</i>: placed initial versions (1.0) of fitHRG and predictHRG online. <br/>
