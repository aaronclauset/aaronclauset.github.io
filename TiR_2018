# [](#header-1)Tenure in Review, 2010-2018
```1 January 2019```

My pre-tenure years started in 2010 and ended in 2018, so I thought it would be interesting to look back at how my "year in review" numbers evolved over time. I'll be updating this document as I do those analyses, so right now, it's just a place holder. Here's a brief list of things I plan to look at:
