University of Colorado at Boulder, and<br/><br/>
External Faculty, Santa Fe Institute<br/><br/>


<h2>Brief Biography</h2>
I came to the <a href="http://cs.colorado.edu">University of Colorado at Boulder</a> 
from the <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/">Santa Fe Institute</a> where I was an Omidyar 
Fellow. I completed my doctoral work in Computer Science at the 
<a href="http://www.unm.edu/">University of New Mexico</a>, under 
<a href="http://www.santafe.edu/~moore/">Cristopher Moore</a>. <br/><br/>

My undergraduate days were spent at <a href="http://www.haverford.edu/">
Haverford College</a>,  where I studied physics and computer science, dabbled in the 
social sciences, and was an active member of student government. 
Some of my fondest memories are from my time at Haverford, where there was 
never a shortage of intelligent or ambitious people with whom to interact. 
As a result, I am a strong supporter of the small liberal arts college 
experience, and particularly so for their role in science education.<br/><br/>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
My research interests are broad. My past and current interests aim to understand the quantitative structure and function of 
social and biological networks, the structure and dynamics of the scientific ecosystem itself, 
the mechanisms that shape patient outcomes in ovarian cancer and the statistics of structural variants in the genome,
evolutionary biology and the processes that shape morphological diversity, and the dynamics of violent political conflict. <br/>

These disparate areas are unified by a central interest in understanding the origins 
and implications of large-scale structural regularities, particularly in social and 
biological systems where contingency and uncertainty play important roles, and in 
the development of computational methods for elucidating them from messy, real-world data.
My research involves both data analysis and computational modeling. This leads me to 
care a lot about statistical epistemology, computational thinking, comparing models and 
real-world data, and other epistemological questions.<br/><br/>

<h2>Extracurricular</h2>
Interspersed throughout my time in academia, I've 
spent time working or consulting in the pharmceutical, financial, intelligence 
and advertising industries, mainly developing statistical methods for making 
accurate predictions in real-world systems. This interest in practical 
solutions to practical problems keeps me connected with more immediate 
concerns, and it ocassionally informs my own research. Not all of my interests 
find an outlet in research, however (perhaps because many of them lay pretty 
far outside my actual expertises), and these instead often serve as material 
for 
<a href="/blog">my blog</a>.
<br/><br/>

On a more personal note, I am an avid traveler, and have enjoyed visiting 49 
of the states (just Alaska to go), as well as about 30 foreign countries on 5 
continents.
