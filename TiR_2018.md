# [](#header-1)Tenure in Review, 2010-2018
```1 January 2019```

My pre-tenure years as an Assistant Professor ran 2010-2018 at the University of Colorado Boulder. In some ways, life as junior faculty is frenetic, and it can be easy to lose sight of events or trends. I thought it would be interesting to look back at how my "year in review" numbers evolved over time, to get a quantitative sense of what changed, by how much, and where things are going. This will also provides some grist for discussing the pressures and privileges of modern faculty life.

* Cumulative published peer-reviewed papers, in journals or competitive conferences:

The initial flatness of the blue line shows how my productivity stalled during my first two years as faculty (2010-2012): I published only 1 new paper during that time, and I remember how much time teaching consumed. In my first year, I developed a new <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/7000/">grad-level course on complex systems</a> (which later transformed into my <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/5352/">grad-level course on network science</a>) and I completely rebuilt our <a href="http://tuvalu.santafe.edu/~aaronc/courses/5454/">grad-level algorithms course</a>. 

Once my research group got up and running and I could reuse my teaching materials, the pipeline started moving again, and it's been pretty steady ever since. Although not a huge effect, the publication numbers in 2012 and 2015 do reflect taking parental leave and a substantial dial-back of my work time during those semesters.

In what should surprise no one in academia, my paper rejections consistently outpace my paper acceptances, at about 1.16 rejection per acceptance. Those rejections were unevenly spread across my papers -- some just took a lot of work to get through peer review. Many of the rejections were from Computer Science conferences. Unlike most of my departmental colleagues, I didn't grow up publishing in a small set of CS conferences, so I had to learn how to write for them on my own, through trial and error. I felt obligated to do this because I was in a CS department and worried about how it would look when I came up for tenure, and I felt that my CS students would need CS publications for when they went looking for jobs.

* Number of students in my research group:

I often counsel new faculty that they should try not to grow their research group too quickly, since learning how to manage advisees doing research is itself something that takes practice. My own group grew very quickly in my second year, which led to lots of fun projects and certainly produced more publications during my pre-tenure years. But, it also stretched me more thinly than I would have liked and was quite stressful. And yet, my group's size didn't peak until 2015-2017, when it contained 5-8 PhD students, plus 1-3 postdocs, 1-2 MS students, and 1-4 BS students. That size was partly driven by my diverse research interests, and I'm happy that my group has included students from Computer Science, Applied Math, Evolutionary Biology, and Biochemistry. It also reflects, I think, an increased confidence in advising students from matriculation to graduation and in managing a diverse portfolio of projects with a diverse group of students.

I do think that, moving forward, a smaller group would be less stressful to manage, possibly at the expense of doing fewer projects. And yet, I'm excited about co-advising and collaborating with the <a href="https://www.colorado.edu/cs/research/complex-systems">half-dozen fantastic young faculty interested in complex systems</a> that Colorado has hired during my pre-tenure years.

* Annual new <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=e7VI_HcAAAAJ&hl=en">citations</a> to past papers:

Not much to say here except that it's both humbling and gratifying to see that other researchers find my work useful and relevant, and that the annual new citations of my papers increased over my pre-tenure years. I've also highlighted the counts <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.1062">my most cited paper</a>, which has had a ridiculous level of impact, but is also (thankfully) a shrinking share of my overall citations.

* Cumulative research talks and popular press pieces:

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig3_talks_n_press.png" alt="talks and press, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

In total, I gave roughly 100 research talks as an Assistant Professor, or about one talk per month, every month, for 8 years. The popular press line covers instances where my research was written about by someone else, sometimes in the news, sometimes on a blog. I'm not sure what happened after 2015.

* Work as a reviewer or editor: 

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig4_reviewing.png" alt="reviewing work, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

During my first few years, as I struggled to balance non-research demands with research, I was counseled that I was doing too much work as a reviewer. That was probably true, but that load hasn't really let up over the years. I did subsequently decline a greater fraction of invitations (from 50% to about 75%), but that was mainly because more invitations were coming in (peaking in 2014 with more than 100).

A major transition occurred in 2015, my first year as a full-time Associate Editor at <a href="http://advances.sciencemag.org/">Science Advances</a> (the open access sister of <i>Science</i>). I was also counseled not to take that job, but did it anyway, because I felt I could help make Science Advances a home for high-quality interdisciplinary work. Another transition occurred in 2017, when Science Advances asked me to become the Deputy Editor responsible for all social and interdisciplinary submissions, managing a group of 10 Associate Editors spanning Anthropology, Computer Science, Economics, Network Science, Psychology, Sociology, and Statistics, and a bit of Computational Biology. This work doesn't even fit on the above graph--I handled 246 submissions in my first 6 months, and nearly 700 in the next 12.

This work has been stimulating (the breadth of submissions is enormous, and I've especially enjoyed the archaeology papers), tiring, and quite gratifying. Looking back now, I think the journal has, in many ways, become what I hoped it would be--although I loath them, Science Advances' first impact factor came in at 11.51, and, more importantly, we've published a lot of papers I think are exceptional contributions to science. There's a lot more I could say about my experience as an editor and how my perspective has evolved on the role of journals in academia and the different models of peer review, but I'll save that for another day.

* Grant proposals:

Alongside the teaching pressure in my first few years, I also submitted a ridiculous number of grant proposals, some of which were for young investigator fellowships with narrow eligibility windows. I also remember feeling that writing successful proposals would take a lot of practice that I hadn't gotten previously (I'd helped write one, to a foundation, as a postdoc), and that I'd probably face a more difficult-than-normal path because of the strongly interdisciplinary style of my research, which didn't fit naturally into any core federal funding program. I don't think I was wrong about those concerns, but the amount of time I spent on this aspect of the job surely took time away from other things.

My big breakthroughs were a large DARPA grant and a small NIH grant in 2012, and since then I've felt more confident both that I could write good proposals and that I had a better sense of what competitions to apply to. Since 2010, I've been lucky enough to receive grants from DARPA, NIH, and NSF, plus a few small grants from private foundations and companies, totaling around $4,500,000. But, I've also come to believe that competing for grants consumes a stupid amount of time, can be supremely frustrating, and I am genuinely uncertain about how this part of my job will evolve in the long-term. tl;dr: I'm not sure I can keep this up for another 30 years.

* Email:

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig6_email.png" alt="emails, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

The volume of emails I send and receive has literally doubled over my pre-tenure years, and I really do spend a lot more time on email now than I did as a brand new professor. If this trend keeps up, I'll receive something like 45,000 emails in 2040. The sent-mail volume is increasing at a slower pace, meaning that I reply to a shrinking fraction of emails I receive. Suddenly, it makes sense why senior faculty have such terrible response rates to emails... I attribute the big dip in sent-mail in 2018 is due to my sabbatical auto-response, which some of you may have gotten.

* Songs and music:

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig7_photos.png" alt="photos and music, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

Something happened in 2012 that fundamentally changed the rate at which I take photos, but didn't do much to my music listening habits. Oh right, it was having kids. The dashed line shows the pre-kid trend extrapolated out to 2018, revealing a roughly 8000 photo "surplus" due to kids. This rate will probably slow down eventually, but if it didn't, by 2040, I'll have crossed 60,000 photos. How do you even begin to sort or browse that many photos?

* Travel:

<img src="/images/TiR_Fig8_travel.png" alt="travel, 2010-2018" height="240" width="483">

The years in which my children were born are clear dips in my work travel, which reflect choices I made about my time during parental leave. On the other hand, 2010, 2013, and 2014 seem notably busy, but I honestly don't remember why. As a younger academic, I loved travel, especially international trips. But as my pre-tenure years progressed, the sheen has worn off; trips are stressful for my family and work-life balance has become more important to me. So it's comforting that the family trips line is so stable across time, despite it requiring a conscious effort, and bringing its own stresses.
