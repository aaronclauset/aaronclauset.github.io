<p><b><big><a name="Description">Description</a></big></b><br/>
Algorithms are the heart of computer science, and their essential nature is 
to automate some aspect of the collecting, organizing and processing of 
information. Today, information of all kinds is increasingly available 
in enormous quantities. However, our ability to make sense of all this 
information, to manage, organize and search it, and to use it for practical 
purposes, e.g., self-driving cars, adaptive computation, search algorithms 
for the Internet or for social networks, artificial intelligence, and many 
scientific applications, relies on the design of efficient algorithms, that 
is, algorithms that are fast, use little memory and provide guarantees on 
their performance.
<br/><br/>

This graduate-level course will cover a selection of topics related to 
algorithm design and analysis. Topics will include divide and conquer 
algorithms, greedy algorithms, graph algorithms, algorithms for social 
networks, computational biology, optimization algorithms, randomized data 
structures and their analysis. We will not cover any of these topics 
exhaustively. Rather, the focus will be on algorithmic thinking, efficient 
solutions to practical problems and understanding algorithm performance. 
Advanced topics will cover a selection of modern algorithms, many of which 
come from real-world applications.
</p>


<p><b><big>Prerequisites</big></b><br/>

CSCI 2270 (Computer Science 2: Data Structures), calculus and discrete 
mathematics, or equivalent. I assume you are already familiar with basic 
asymoptotic analysis (Big-O, etc.) and can solve recurrence relations. The 
ability to quickly and correctly implement basic algorithms is essential. (If 
you are not confident on this point, you should not take the course.)
If you don't have the necessary background, please see me. There will also 
be a brief survey at the beginning of the semester to help me get an idea of 
the class's preparation.
</p>

<p><b><big><a name="CourseWork">Course work and grading</a></big></b><br/>
Attendance to the lectures is required.
<br/><br/>
The first half of the course will be lecture and problem-set driven. The five 
problem sets will each have some mathematical and some programming problems. 
Programming problems can be done in any reasonable imperative language (C++, 
Java, Python, etc.), and run-able source code must be submitted for each 
solution. Unless specifically allowed, all parts of all algorithms and data 
structures must be implemented from scratch (that is, no libraries; if you use 
Python or another modern language, be sure you are not accidentally invoking 
non-trivial libraries; garbage collection features are okay). For the 
mathematical problems, you should assume a RAM model of computation.
<br/><br/>

Problem sets will be due three weeks after they are assigned. Solutions must 
be in PDF format (e.g., typeset using 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX">LaTeX</a>), 
should include all necessary details for me to follow the logic, and should be 
submitted via email by 11:59pm the day they are due. No late assignments will 
be accepted.  Collaboration is allowed on the problem sets, but you may not 
copy (in any way) from your collaborators and you must respect University 
academic policies at all times. That is, you may discuss the problems 
verbally, but you must write up your solutions separately. If you do
work with someone, you must list and describe the extent of your collaboration 
in your solutions (a footnote is fine). Copying from any source in any way, 
including the Web but especially from another student (past or present), is 
strictly forbidden. If you are unsure about whether something is permitted, 
please see me before the assignment is due.
<br/><br/>
<a name="Crowdsource">The</a> 
second half of the class will revolve around crowd-sourced lectures on 
more advanced topics and additional problem sets. For the lectures, students 
will form small groups (of 2) and give a full-length (75 minute) technical 
lecture that (i) motivates the problem the algorithm solves, (ii) describes 
the algorithm in appropriate detail (at least at the pseudocode level), (iii) 
analyzes its performance in appropriate detail and (iv) describes interesting 
extensions of the technique. 
Each team will also submit their lecture notes, in PDF via email by 11:59pm 
the day they give their lecture. No late submissions will be accepted.
The lecture and the lecture notes are one of the major deliverables of the 
class and I expect students to spend a significant amount of time outside of 
class preparing this material. Students should form their own groups by 
February 7th and email me, by February 14th, their team's preferences in the 
form of a complete ranking of all 11 topics. Assignments to topics will be 
made using a matching algorithm. (The number of topics and the precise 
schedule may change slightly during the semester depending on the number of 
students in the class.) The grade for the lecture will be partly determined by 
the in-class presentation and partly by the quality of the lecture notes.
<br/><br/>

There are no written examinations in this class. The lecture should be viewed 
as a kind of oral examination.
<br/><br/>

Most of my lectures will have an accompanying reading assignment, typically 
taken from the textbook. Details of the readings will be given in the lecture notes, or posted here.
<br/><br/>

The grade for the course will be 20% attendance, 30% crowd-sourced lecture, 
50% problem sets.

<!--<p><b><big><a name="Crowdsource">Crowd-source Lecture Topics</a></big></b><br/>
Students are free to choose any one of these topics for their crowd-sourced 
lecture: DNA sequence alignment, algorithmic game theory, Byzantine agreement, 
algorithms for statistical forecasting, expectation-maximization, 
linear programming, solvers for Satisfiability, min-max algorithms for 
2-player games. -->



<!--<p><b><big>Class Project</big></b><br/>
The assignment is to implement, from scratch, one of the algorithms presented 
in class, analyze it and conduct thorough numerical experiments to demonstrate 
the correctness of the analysis, the correctness of the implementation, and 
the failure modes under usual or pathological inputs. Students will work 
independently, will turn in their code and a 10-page writeup of their results 
at the end of the semester.<br/><br/>

Project proposals are due, via email, on February 28th; these should include 
two paragraphs, one describing the motivation of the algorithm and the other 
describing the algorithm's solution to the problem it solves. The final 
writeup (in PDF) is due by email on April 29 (last day of classes). -->
