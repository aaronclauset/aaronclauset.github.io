# A new home
```30 December 2017```

With the closing of my original [*Structure+Strangeness* blog](http://www.cs.unm.edu/~aaron/blog/), this site is a new home for my long-form but non-academic writing. Thoughts about science, academia, networks, peer review, journals, artificial intelligence, complexity, computational social science, computational biology, and far more. *Structure+Strangeness* has always been a place for thinking aloud and a place for storing public artifacts. The name comes from a chapter in the book version of [Douglas Hofstadter's *Metamagical Themas*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamagical_Themas). The book contained a collection of thought provoking ideas that stirred my imagination as a young teenager.
