# [](#header-1)A new home

My group's research activities are broad and multidisciplinary, and we are active participants in the network science, complex systems, computational biology, and computational social science communities. Our work generally focuses on understanding the mechanisms by which large-scale patterns emerge from the collective actions of heterogeneous individuals and on developing novel techniques for inferring such patterns and mechanisms from rich data sources. Much of this work is methdological in nature, and we actively develop novel statistical and computational methods for automatically analyzing and modeling complex phenomena in biological, social and technological systems. All of these efforts draw heavily on data analysis, machine learning, statistics, probability, algorithms and graph theory. We are particularly interested in interactions between theory and data, and the development of rigorous methods for the study of complex systems.
